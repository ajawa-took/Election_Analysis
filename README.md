## Election-Audit Summary

 With small modifications, this script can also be used to see how well each candidate did in each county, answering questions such as who won Arapahoe county and by how much.

 With extra data from voter registration rolls, the script could also be modified to compute the more common measure of election turnout: the franction of registered voters that cast votes in this election. Both state-wide and county-by-county numbers can be obtained.

 Another small modification of the code could automatically produce the second section of this report, placing the results in sentences instead of tables.
